Create a Personal Access token on github
It is a authentication method which very secure
This is used whenever we have to push files or changes form Local to remote
There is not concept of using password, instead we have to use Personal access token in git locally

Demo:

Go to settings of github → on the left side → go to developer settings → go to Personal Access tokens → Generate New token
Note→ give a name to the token
Expiration -> 30 days
Select scope : repo (1 checkbox) 
Click on generate token

Make sure to copy your personal access token now. You won’t be able to see it again! 

Connect Local repo to remote repo
	Go to git and execute this command

  $ git remote add origin https://github.com/Sonal0409/myproject206Aug.git

Execute the command to check local and remote repo is set:

  $ git remote -v

To remove local repo and remote repo connection:

$ git remote rm origin

Command that can be used to update existing remote origin:

$ git remote set-url origin <url
Pushing the file to remote from local repo

$ git push origin master

Username : <guthubusername>
Password: give your personal access token

Note: you will not be able to see the token text on screen.. Go ahead and press enter key

Day 4: Agenda:
*********************************************************


Adding collaborators to remote repository, so other github user can push into my repository from his local repo

Pulling file from remote github repo  to local repo

In your git hub repo , add some new files:

And commit them in github

Pull those files to your local

$ git pull origin master
Pulling a specific file form a remote repo to local

Create 2 new files in github

In the local git CLI

Execute the command:

$ git fetch origin master

⇒ this command will only fetch the new changes from the remote repo and commits
⇒ it will not merge with WD & LR

For your information - no need to execute:

How to Check what has been fetched from remote repo

cd .git

cat FETCH_HEAD

You will a single commit with remote files information in it

cd ..

$  git diff 2830d1093a8f519b68c929cb4501ad1c247c9fe3

This will show you, which files are not in your local, but are there in remote
Diff ⇒ difference
In this case, diff with commit id , will tell us what has been fetched from remote repo

In order to merge a single file form remote to local repo


Execute this:

$ git checkout origin/master <filename>

$  git checkout origin/master fetchfile1

$ git status ⇒ file will be staged

$ git commit -m “message”


Clonign a repo

git clone repoPath

========================

Fork a repo
Forking is copying the remote repo from github account to another github account

Copying repository remote to remote

A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
